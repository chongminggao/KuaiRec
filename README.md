# KuaiRec: A Fully-observed Dataset for Recommender Systems (Density: Almost 100%)

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY--SA%204.0-green)](https://github.com/chongminggao/KuaiRec/blob/main/LICENSE)

*KuaiRec* is a real-world dataset collected from the recommendation logs of the video-sharing mobile app [Kuaishou](https://www.kuaishou.com/cn). For now, it is the first dataset that contains a fully observed user-item interaction matrix. For the term "fully observed", we mean there are almost no missing values in the user-item matrix,  i.e., each user has viewed each video and then left feedback. 

Other related **open-sourced** datasets are **[KuaiRand](https://kuairand.com/)** and **[KuaiSAR](https://kuaisar.github.io/)**.

The following figure illustrates the user-item matrices in traditional datasets and *KuaiRec*.

With all user preferences known, KuaiRec can used in offline evaluation (i.e., offline A/B test) for recommendation models. It can benefit lots of research directions, such as unbiased recommendation, interactive/conversational recommendation, reinforcement learning (RL), and off-policy evaluation (OPE) for recommendation.

## News!

**2024.06.02: To facilitate the application of large language models (LLM) in recommendation systems, we collect caption information and category information for all videos and presented them in text format!** 

- The corresponding caption and category information can be downloaded here: [kuairec_caption_category.csv](https://github.com/chongminggao/KuaiRec/blob/main/kuairec_caption_category.csv). Additionally, we have packaged them into the `KuaiRec.zip` file, which can be downloaded from the download section below.  
- The descriptions of the caption and category information are available [here](#6-descriptions-of-the-caption-and-category-fields-in-kuairec_caption_categorycsv-added-on-20240602).

**2022.05.16: We update the dataset to version 2.0.** We made the following changes:

- We removed the unused video `ID=1225` from all tables having the field `video_id` and re-indexed the rest videos, i.e., `ID = ID - 1 if ID > 1225`. 
- We added two tables to enhance the side information for users and videos, respectively. See `4.item_daily_features.csv` and `5. user_features.csv` under the data description section for details.




## Download the data

We provide several options to download this dataset:

  Option 1. Download via the "wget" command.

```shell
 wget https://nas.chongminggao.top:4430/datasets/KuaiRec.zip --no-check-certificate
 unzip KuaiRec.zip
```
  Option 2. Download manually through the following links:

  - Optional link 1: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qe5hOSBxzIuxBb1G_Ih5X-O65QElollE/view?usp=sharing)

## Data Descriptions

*KuaiRec* contains millions of user-item interactions as well as side information including the item categories and a social network. Six files are included in the download data: 

  ```shell

  │   ├── big_matrix.csv          
  │   ├── small_matrix.csv
  │   ├── social_network.csv

  ```

The statistics of the small matrix and big matrix in *KuaiRec*.

|                | #Users | #Items | #Interactions | Density |
| -------------- | :----: | :----: | :-----------: | :-----: |
| *small matrix* | 1,411  | 3,327  |   4,676,570   |  99.6%  |
| *big matrix*   | 7,176  | 10,728 |  12,530,806   |  16.3%  |

Note that the density of the small matrix is 99.6% instead of 100% because some users have explicitly indicated that they would not be willing to receive recommendations from certain authors. I.e., They blocked these videos.

#### 1. Descriptions of the fields in `big_matrix.csv` and `small_matrix.csv`. 

| Field Name:    | Description                                              | Type    | Example                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| user_id        | The ID of the user.                                      | int64   | 0                         |
| video_id       | The ID of the viewed video.                              | int64   | 3650                      |
| play_duration  | Time of video viewing of this interaction (millisecond). | int64   | 13838                     |
| video_duration | Time of this video (millisecond).                        | int64   | 10867                     |
| time           | Human-readable date for this interaction                 | str     | "2020-07-05 00:08:23.438" |
| date           | Date of this interaction                                 | int64   | 20200705                  |
| timestamp      | Unix timestamp                                           | float64 | 1593878903.438            |
| watch_ratio    | The video watching ratio (=play_duration/video_duration) | float64 | 1.273397                  |

The "watch_ratio" can be deemed as the label of the interaction. Note: there is no "like" signal for this dataset. If you need this binary signal in your scenarios, you can create it yourself. E.g., `like = 1 if watch_ratio > 2.0`.
